I've always been wanting to blog more, but I've never been able to find the time or think that what I had was not good enough. Inspired by [this post on hackernews](https://xuanwo.io/links/2025/01/link-blog/), which is itself ispired by Simon Willison's [link blogging](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/), I'll try to start this way.

> blogging doesn’t have to be about unique insights. The value is in writing frequently and having something to show for it over time—worthwhile even if you don’t attract much of an audience (or any audience at all).

> That’s the purpose of my link blog: it’s an ongoing log of things I’ve found—effectively a combination of public bookmarks and my own thoughts and commentary on why those things are interesting.

Essentially, I will be posting links to content I find interesting, trying to be a good resource for myself and others, discriminating signal from noise, and of course add a bit of my own thoughts.
